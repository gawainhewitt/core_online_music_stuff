# Core Online Music Stuff

This contains all my progress to date and serves as a reference for me when making interactive music and art projects. At the time of writing this project contains what I've learned about the following:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* p5.js for graphics and animation (I have stopped using their sound library or their event listeners)
* Tone.js
* Netlify
* Github
